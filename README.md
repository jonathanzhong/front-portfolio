#PROJECT 1 - PORTFOLIO
![](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=Progress)
##Objective:
You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects.




##What I Have Done:
 - Build up portfolio website with provided mockup implementing HTML and CSS based on the framework of Bootstrap.
 - Applied responsive website design displaying contents relatively according to different screen sizes. (Don't forget to add the code `<meta name = viewport content = "width = device-width, initial-scale = 1"> ` into the header, then you can define specific sponsive actions in CSS file, like font size, content rearrangement and etc, that the browser takes when the browser width changes)
